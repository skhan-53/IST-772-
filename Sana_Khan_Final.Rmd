```{r}
#load in the datasets 
district6 <- load("/Users/gozi/Downloads/districts6.RData")

Question 1

1.  How have U.S. vaccination rates varied over time? Are vaccination rates increasing or decreasing? Which vaccination has the highest rate at the conclusion of the time series? Which vaccination has the lowest rate at the conclusion of the time series? Which vaccine has the greatest volatility?

```{r}

summary(usVaccines)

plot(usVaccines)

boxplot(usVaccines)

library(changepoint)
vaccinediff <- diff(usVaccines)
plot(vaccinediff)


DTP1 <-usVaccines[,1]
DTP1cp <-cpt.mean(DTP1)
DTP1cp
plot(cpt.mean(diff(DTP1)))
cpt.var(diff(DTP1))
        
HepB_BD   <-usVaccines[,2]
HepB_BDcp <-cpt.mean(HepB_BD)
HepB_BDcp
plot(cpt.mean(diff(HepB_BD)))
cpt.mean(diff(HepB_BD))
cpt.var(diff(HepB_BD))



 Pol3 <-usVaccines[,3]
Pol3cp <-cpt.mean( Pol3)
Pol3cp
plot(cpt.mean(diff(Pol3)))
cpt.mean(diff(Pol3))
cpt.var(diff(Pol3))


 Hib3 <-usVaccines[,4]
Hib3cp <-cpt.mean( Hib3)
Hib3cp
plot(cpt.mean(diff(Hib3)))
cpt.var(diff(Hib3))


 MCV1 <-usVaccines[,5]
MCV1cp <-cpt.mean(MCV1)
MCV1cp 
plot(cpt.mean(diff(MCV1)))
cpt.var(diff(MCV1))
```

2.  What proportion of public schools reported vaccination data? What proportion of private schools reported vaccination data? Was there any credible difference in overall reporting proportions between public and private schools?

```{r}


#calculate table
 schooltable <- table(allSchoolsReportStatus$pubpriv,allSchoolsReportStatus$reported)
schooltable
 
#calculate margin table

 margin.table(schooltable)
margin.table(schooltable,1)
margin.table(schooltable,2)

# Calculate probabilities 

schoolProbs <- schooltable/margin.table(schooltable) 
                                                         
schoolProbs  

 

```

3.  What are 2013 vaccination rates for individual vaccines (i.e., DOT, Polio, MMR, and HepB) in California public schools? How do these rates for individual vaccines in California districts compare with overall US vaccination rates (make an informal comparison to the final observations in the time series)?

```{r}

plot(districts)

summary(districts)


 mean( districts$WithoutDTP )
  districts$withDTP <- (100 - districts$WithoutDTP )
 mean(districts$withDTP)
 
 
 mean( districts$WithoutPolio )
 districts$WithPolio <- (100 - districts$WithoutPolio )
 mean( districts$WithPolio )

 
 mean( districts$WithoutMMR )
  districts$withMMR <- (100 - districts$WithoutMMR )
 mean(districts$withMMR)
  
  mean( districts$WithoutHepB )
    districts$withHepB<- (100 - districts$WithoutHepB )
  mean( districts$withHepB )

    
mean(districts$PctUpToDate)
summary(usVaccines)



  
```

4.  Among districts, how are the vaccination rates for individual vaccines related? In other words, if students are missing one vaccine are they missing all of the others?

```{r}


cordist <- cor(districts[,2:6]) 
cordist
cordist1 <- cor(districts[,2:5]) 
cordist1
mean(cordist)
mean(cordist1)


quantile(cordist,probs=c(0.025,0.975))

quantile(cordist1,probs=c(0.025,0.975))

library(corrplot)
x <- cor(districts[,2:6])
corrplot(x, type="upper", order="hclust")

x2 <- cor(districts[,2:5])
corrplot(x2, type="upper", order="hclust")

```

5.  What variables predict whether or not a district's reporting was complete?

```{r}

glmOut <- glm(formula = DistrictComplete ~ PctChildPoverty + PctFreeMeal+ PctFamilyPoverty + Enrolled +TotalSchools, family  =binomial(), data =districts)


summary(glmOut)

glmOutExp <- exp(coef(glmOut))
exp(confint(glmOutExp))
```

```{r}
anova(glmOut, test="Chisq")
```

```{r}

library(BaylorEdPsych) 
PseudoR2(glmOut)
```

```{r}
table(round(predict(glmOut, type="response")), districts$DistrictComplete)
```

```{r}
#baysian approach
library(MCMCpack)

bayesLogitOut <- MCMClogit(DistrictComplete ~ PctChildPoverty + PctFreeMeal + PctFamilyPoverty + Enrolled + TotalSchools, data = districts) 
summary(bayesLogitOut)
plot(bayesLogitOut)
```

6.  What variables predict the percentage of all enrolled students with completely up-to-date vaccines?

```{r}
#install.packages("car")
library(car)
#linear
regOutvac <- lm(PctUpToDate ~ PctChildPoverty + PctFreeMeal + PctFamilyPoverty + Enrolled + TotalSchools, data=districts)
summary(regOutvac) 

summary(residuals(regOutvac))

vif(regOutvac)


#bayesian
regOutBvac <- lmBF(PctUpToDate ~ PctChildPoverty + PctFreeMeal + PctFamilyPoverty + Enrolled + TotalSchools, data=districts) 
regOutBvac



regOutMCMCvac <- lmBF(PctUpToDate ~ PctChildPoverty + PctFreeMeal + PctFamilyPoverty + Enrolled + TotalSchools, data=districts, posterior=TRUE, iterations=10000)
summary(regOutMCMC)


plot(regOutMCMCvac)

```

7.  What variables predict the percentage of all enrolled students with belief exceptions?

```{r}

regOutbelief <- lm(PctBeliefExempt ~ PctChildPoverty + PctFreeMeal + PctFamilyPoverty + Enrolled + TotalSchools, data=districts)
summary(regOutbelief) 

summary(residuals(regOutbelief))


regOutMCMCbelief <- lmBF(PctBeliefExempt ~ PctChildPoverty + PctFreeMeal + PctFamilyPoverty + Enrolled + TotalSchools, data=districts, posterior=TRUE, iterations=10000)
summary(regOutMCMCbelief)



regOutBbelief <- lmBF(PctBeliefExempt ~ PctChildPoverty + PctFreeMeal + PctFamilyPoverty + Enrolled + TotalSchools, data=districts)
regOutBbelief

plot(regOutMCMCbelief)

```
